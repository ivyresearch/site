Ivy Research is a group of renegades -- excited by aesthetic design, cryptography, math, product vision, protocol design, user interaction, hardware, and security. We have deep connection to zero knowledge cryptography theory and novel technology (including published papers), as well as folks deeply excited by products and visions of how cryptographic applications can help the people of the world Interact VerifiablY (IVY) with each other.

Specific projects incubated in-house or directly mentored are:
- ZK NFC: Proofs of signatures from RFID/NFC cards enable verifiable physical history
- ZK Email: Proofs of email on-chain enable identity proofs and account abstraction
- Nozee: Proofs of JWT tokens from OpenAI allow anyone to prove anonymous membership of an email domain
- PLUME: Proofs of unique Ethereum identity enable anonymous proof of solvency and zk voting
- Morpheus: Proofs of transformation of generated content proves provenance and origin, including for AI

We will release blog post for all of these projects in July 2023. If you're excited about this future, email team@ivyresearch.org to get in touch. We are especially excited to hear from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure that everyone is included in the future of digital expression!
<!-- ## Goodbye world is a `templ` template example

Every time `Click Me!` is clicked, a request is sent to the API server, which renders `templ GoodbyeWorld()` from `partial/templates.templ`.
