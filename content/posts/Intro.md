Ivy Research is a group of renegades, focusing on tech that **enables humans to interact verifiably**. We support projects that provide more intimacy and privacy in our internet lives, either by securely generating or selectively revealing personal cryptographic data. We also support projects that improve the onboarding experience to other verifiable technologies like Ethereum, bringing the power of blockchain to the next billion people.

Specific projects incubated in-house or directly mentored are:

- [Zupass Stamps](https://pse-team.notion.site/Zupass-Stamps-Retrospective-v1-6bd7aa223f4d41cdb59b4ecf8aafb130): Proofs of signatures from NFC cards enable verifiable physical interactions
- [ZK Email](https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/zkemail/): Proofs of email on-chain enable identity proofs and account abstraction
- [heyanon](https://www.heyanon.wtf/): Verifiably post as an anonymous member of an on-chain or in-person group
- [Nozee](https://www.nozee.xyz/): Proof of ownership of JSON Web Tokens from OpenAI, allowing anyone to prove anonymous membership of an email domain
- [PLUME](https://blog.aayushg.com/posts/nullifier): Proofs of unique Ethereum identity enable anonymous proof of solvency and zk voting
- [WebAuthn research](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/tree/main/packages/heyauthn): Enabling everyone with a browser to generate signatures and Semaphore identities
- [Morpheus](https://dannybess.notion.site/Morpheus-a-perceptual-hash-based-registry-with-proofs-of-transformation-7d6b040d822d426a94813658844da49c): Proofs of transformation of generated content proves provenance and origin, including for AI

We will release blog post for all of these projects in August 2023. If you're excited about this future, email team@ivyresearch.org to get in touch. We are especially excited to hear from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure that everyone is included in the future of verifiable interactions!

<!-- ## Goodbye world is a `templ` template example

Every time `Click Me!` is clicked, a request is sent to the API server, which renders `templ GoodbyeWorld()` from `partial/templates.templ`.

{{< html.inline >}}
<button
  hx-get="{{ .Site.Params.apiBaseUrl }}/goodbyeworld.html"
  hx-trigger="click"
  hx-target="#goodbye"
  hx-swap="beforeend">
  Click Me!
