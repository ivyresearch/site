Cryptography is often seen as something mathematical and cold. When combined with the rest of the classic blockchain ecosystem, it leaves an even worse taste in users' mouths: airdrops meant for VC liquidity and forcing users into awkward usecases makes it often feel alien and unfamiliar.

We think this is because the modalities in which it's been brought to people has not personable enough: the overlap of projects based on crazy novel innovations in the zero knowledge cryptography, brought to people via beautiful design has never really been explored well. We hope that by enabling a diverse set of Verifiable Interactions (VeIns), we can replace this foreign machine with something based on our humanities, something that allows us to be more honest and vulnerable, and own our own data instead of an ivory tower of greedy software companies.

We are inspired by the feeling of ripping out the wires and replacing them with veins. Let us illustrate: when all of your own data lives on your own devices, you are the sole owner of your proofs, data, and identity.

Studio Ivy focuses on tech that **enables humans to interact verifiably**. If you're excited to contribute to this mission, we would love to hear from you. Reach out to us -- our Twitter, Discord, and email is open to anyone.
