Cryptography is often seen as something mathematical and cold. When combined with the rest of the classic blockchain ecosystem, it leaves an even worse taste in users' mouths: airdrops meant for VC liquidity and forcing users into awkward usecases makes it often feel alien and unfamiliar.

We think this is because the modalities in which it's been brought to people has not personable enough: the overlap of projects based on crazy novel innovations in the zero knowledge cryptography, brought to people via beautiful design has never really been explored well. We hope that by enabling a diverse set of Verifiable Interactions (VeIns), we can replace this foreign machine with something based on our humanities, something that allows us to be more honest and vulnerable, and own our own data instead of an ivory tower of greedy software companies.

We are inspired by the feeling of ripping out the wires and replacing them with veins. Forget grids of identities: the things you collect from different places should feel tactile and fun to interact with. Proofs you collect should feel fun: you tap a card to your phone, and you get something to build and upgrade your personal avatar: you enchant your sword, or switch your hats, or duel with other people's weapons.

Let us illustrate the concrete overlap with our research: when all of your own data lives on your own devices, you are the sole owner of your proofs, data, and identity. The only authentication we trust comes from signatures: signatures from physical NFC cards, signatures from your email, signature-creating NFC tags we hide in clothing, and signatures from your Ethereum PLUMEs. These credentials live in the same secure enclave that verifies your fingerprint with tap-to-pay, and live in your existing keystore: your Apple or Google Wallet. The ZK proofs of this information are relayed to the applications you use and connected to the rest of your identities, and the physical evidence of your presence can be used as gating for discussions. You never have to interact with a blockchain, you can onboard people via emails and use zk-email to prove that they authorized transfers of their assets. The entire ecosystem is open: if you contribute something, you can submit a Morpheus proof to prove your ownership of that content.

Studio Ivy focuses on tech that **enables humans to interact verifiably**. If you're excited to contribute to this mission, we would love to hear from you. Reach out to us -- our Twitter, Discord, and email is open to anyone.

Ideas from discussions with Justin, Althea, Rachel, IYK, and Richard.
